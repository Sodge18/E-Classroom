# E-Classroom
Proposal solution for making new era e-classroom for student all over the world. Standard classroom with plenty of electric devices and New-Era school system of education.

This is PowerPoint presentation which is made for solution proposal "E-Classroom". The idea is to make an classroom that fulfills all the requirements that are stated in this presentation. Actually, this classroom project presents new era in school system and education system because of its information technology that is included in normal classroom functionality (TVs, AI, Automated System in physical classroom, etc.).
  
The reason why I made this solution proposal is for the competition for the best youth technical inovation of 2022, so-called "INOST" (initials when translated to Serbian).
If we assume that this was national competition, I made great results! I won Bronze Plaque for my "E-Classroom", and I am proud of myself because this is personal response that I am getting better and am improving myself day after day.

I wanted to share this solution proposal to the GitHub in case somebody finds my project, and I hope, uses it in near future and actually makes this E-Classroom become true and real.
  If you are reading this, I think you might like this solution proposal and I hope you reach high results with it. Please contact me or mention me in your final project as a source guy from GitHub. Wish you the best luck.
  
  
This PowerPoint presentation is in Serbian language, so if you need to translate it, I left the presentation opened so you can copy and edit the text and all the content inside.

Good luck!
